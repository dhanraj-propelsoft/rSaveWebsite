                If any Capital Asset is sold or transferred, the profits arising out of such sale are taxable as capital gains in the year in which the transfer takes place.</p>
            <p>
                Definition of capital asset</p>
            <p align="justify">
                Capital Asset means all moveable or immovable property except trading goods, personal effects, agricultural land other than within municipal areas or within 8 kilometers from it wherever notified and gold bonds. Jewelry and ornament are not personal effects and their sale will attract capital gains.</p>
            <p>
                Distinction between short term and long-term asset</p>
            <p align="justify">
                Capital Assets are of two types i.e., long term and short term. Long-term capital assets are assets held for more than 36 months before they are sold or transferred. In case of shares, debentures and mutual fund units the period of holding required is only 12 months. Different rates of tax apply for gains on transfer of the long term and short-term capital assets. Gains on short-term capital asset are taxed as regular income.</p>
            <p>
                Computation of Capital Gains</p>
            <p>
                Capital gains are to be computed by deducting the following three amounts from the consideration money received on transfer of the asset.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The actual cost of the asset or its estimated market value as on 1.4.81, if acquired earlier;</li>
                <li>The cost of improvement, if any, for the asset;</li>
                <li>Expenses incurred on transfer of the asset; and</li>
            </ol>
                <p>
                    In case of a long-term capital asset, the costs are increased as per a Cost inflation index for the year.</p>

            <p>
                <br>
                Exemptions from Capital Gains<br>
                In case of Individuals and HUF, long-term capital gains are exempt if the sale proceeds are reinvested in certain assets.</p>
            <p>
                Some examples:</p>
            <p>
                A) Profits on sale of residential house is reinvested in a new residential &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>
            <p>
                B) Long term capital gains are invested in notified bonds</p>
            <p>
                These exemptions are subject to certain conditions and the reinvestment has to be made within the prescribed time.</p>

                Tax implication of an investment if not the sole but is the most important consideration while evaluating various investment opportunities. It is impertinent for a person to know the tax aspect of an investment opportunity before he parks his money. This is important because of the fact that tax paid reduces the returns generated and it becomes necessary for an investor to know the real rate of return on his investments.</p>

            <p align="justify">
                Investing in ELSS provides an investor with twin benefit of tax saving and scope of good returns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                The incorporation of Section 80C in the Income Tax Act, 1961 has proved to be a boon for the investor. Now an investor can claim deduction u/s 80C by investing in ELSS. By investing in this scheme an investor can save tax up to Rs.33600.<br>
                <br>
                ELSS requires the investor to lock in his money for 3 years. This is necessary because of the fact that in long run the scope of negative returns from equities reduces tremendously. Over periods of time equities have outperformed the other asset classes.</p>

            What is the tax implication of a bonus/rights issue on equity shares?</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">
                Under Section 55(2)(AA), bonus on equity shares has a zero (nil) cost of acquisition. The holding period is calculated from the date of allotment of equity shares. The net sales proceeds are treated as the capital gain. The period of holding of such issue is reckoned from the date of the allotment of such issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                The cost of acquisition of the rights issue on equity shares is the amount actually paid for acquiring such right according to Section 55(2) (AA) (iii). The holding period is reckoned from the date of allotment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                Where there is a transfer of these rights, the cost of acquisition of such rights is to be taken as 'nil' according to Section 55(2) (AA) (ii). The sale price of such transferred rights will be taken as capital gain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                The period of holding in the hands of the transferor is computed from the date of offer, made by the company to the date of renouncement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                In case of the transfer of such rights, the cost of acquisition is the aggregate of the amount of purchase price, paid to the transferor to acquire the right entitlement and the amount, paid by him to the company for subscribing to such right offer of share.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>

            <p align="justify">
                The split shares represent the sub-divided shares of a lot of shares. The cost of such shares gets proportionately divided and the period of holding also continues to be the same as that of the original lot.</p>

            <p align="justify">
                In case of equity or preference shares in a company, if the shares are held for more than 12 months immediately prior to its transfer then it is known as long term capital asset and on transfer of long term capital asset, long term capital arises. Long term capital gains arising on transfer of equity shares will not be chargeable to tax from assessment year 2005-06 if such transaction is covered by securities transaction tax under section 10(38).</p>

            <p align="justify">
                In case of multiple demat accounts, the capital gains on sale of shares has to be computed on the basis of the FIFO with reference to the particular account from where the shares are sold. The FIFO method was introduced to bypass the process of determining the cost on one to one basis with the particular DP.</p>

                <br>
                A short-term capital loss can be set off against any capital gain (long-term and short-term). However a long-term capital loss can be set off only against a long-term capital gain.</p>

                The Securities Transaction Tax has been introduced by Chapter VII of the Finance Act (No.2) Act, 2004. It provides for a levy of a transaction tax on the value of certain transactions. These transactions include the purchase and sale of equity shares in a company, purchase and sale of units of an equity growth fund, sale of a unit of an equity growth fund to the mutual fund and sale of a derivative. The transaction tax will be payable on all transactions that have taken effect from October 1, 2004.</p>

                                        Interest income on fixed deposits and bonds, such as 8% Savings (Taxable) Bonds, 2003, is taxable under the head "Income from other sources". The entire income received is taxable. However, an assessee can claim direct expenses incurred to earn that income under the provisions of Section 57(iii).<br>

                                        Investments in capital gains savings bonds enable investors to avoid paying the capital gains tax. These bonds are issued by REC and NHAI. For example, when a property is sold and a long-term capital gains tax liability arises, the assessee has an option to avoid it by investing the capital gains in another property within the specified time duration. Another option available to him (to avoid paying tax) is to invest the requisite sum in capital gains bonds within a period of 6 months from date of transfer.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Investors should ensure that these bonds are not transferred or converted within a period of 3 years from the date of acquisition; also no loan, mortgage or encumbrances should be created on these bonds. In such an event, investors will lose the tax benefits and capital gains will become taxable.</p>

            <strong>What are the tax implications if a person buys a house with a loan and sells it (a) within the same year, (b) after three years? Further, what is the impact on benefits related to interest and capital repayment?</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">
                If a person buys a house and sells it within the same year/after 3 years, and if any profit is made, then a capital gains tax liability arises on the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                Let us take an example to better understand the same. For example, if you purchase a house for Rs 500,000 by taking a loan and you sell it in the same year for Rs 700,000, then you make a profit of Rs 200,000. On this profit, you will be liable to pay short-term capital gains tax since the sale took place in the same year. But, if the sale had taken place after 3 years, then a long-term capital gains tax liability would have arisen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                The long-term capital gains will be exempt from tax if the profit amount (after factoring in the indexation benefits) is invested in capital gains tax saving bonds or in a house property as specified under Section 54.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>

            <strong>Under what circumstances can the tax benefit for taking a home loan towards purchase of a property be denied?</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">
                If it is proved that the home loan is simply an arrangement between the loan-seeker and the builder or with a third party for the purpose of claiming tax benefits, then tax benefits will not be allowed and benefits, previously claimed, will be clubbed to the income and taxed accordingly.</p>

                Dividends declared by debt-oriented mutual funds (i.e. mutual funds with less than 65% of assets in equities), are tax-free in the hands of the investor. However, a dividend distribution tax of 14.03% (including surcharge) is to be paid by the mutual fund on the dividends declared. Long-term debt funds, government securities funds (gsec/gilt funds), monthly income plans (MIPs) are examples of debt-oriented funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                Dividends declared by equity-oriented funds (i.e. mutual funds with more than 65% of assets in equities) are tax-free in the hands of investor. There is also no dividend distribution tax applicable on these funds. Diversified equity funds, sector funds, balanced funds (with more than 65% of net assets in equities) are examples of equity-oriented funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                Amount invested in tax-saving funds (ELSS) would be eligible for deduction under Section 80C, however the aggregate amount deductible under the said section cannot exceed Rs 100,000.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>

                Section 2(42A):<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
                Under Section 2(42A) of the Act, a unit of a mutual fund is treated as short-term capital asset if the same is held for less than 12 months. The units held for more than twelve months are treated as long-term capital asset.<br>

This makes long-term capital gains on equity-oriented funds exempt from tax from assessment year 2005-06.<br>

                Short term capital gains on equity-oriented funds is chargeable to tax @10% (plus education cess, applicable surcharge).

                Long-term capital gains on debt-oriented funds are subject to tax @20% of capital gain after allowing indexation benefit or at 10% flat without indexation benefit, whichever is less.<br>
                <br>
                Short-term capital gains on debt-oriented funds are subject to tax at the tax bracket applicable (marginal tax rate) to the investor.</p>

                "Units" are included in the proviso to the sub-section (1) to Section 112 of the Act and hence, unit holders can opt for being taxed at 10% (plus applicable surcharge, education cess) without the cost inflation index benefit or 20% (plus applicable surcharge) with the cost inflation index benefit, whichever is beneficial.<br>

        </p>
            <p align="justify">
                This is a practice that is popularly referred to as 'dividend stripping'. The capital loss from a dividend declaration can be offset if you have remained invested in the mutual fund 3 months before and 9 months after the dividend declaration. If you haven't adhered to this guideline then you cannot offset the capital loss arising from a dividend declaration.</p>

            What is the tax implication of a bonus/rights issue on mutual fund units?</strong></p>
            <p align="justify">
                Under Section 55(2) (AA), bonus on mutual fund units has a zero (nil) cost of acquisition. The holding period is calculated from the date of allotment of mutual fund units. The net sales proceeds are treated as the capital gain. The period of holding of such issue is reckoned from the date of the allotment of such issue.<br>
                <br>
                The cost of acquisition of the rights issue on mutual fund units is the amount actually paid for acquiring such right, according to Section 55(2) (AA) (iii). The holding period is reckoned from the date of allotment.<br>
                <br>
                Where there is a transfer of these rights, the cost of acquisition of such rights is to be taken as 'Nil' according to Section 55(2) (AA) (ii). Sale price of such transferred rights will be taken as capital gain.<br>
                <br>
                The period of holding in the hands of the transferor is computed from the date of offer, made by the company to the date of renouncement.</p>
